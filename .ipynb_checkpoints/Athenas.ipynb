    "Customer Survey Dataset The dataset is a collection of responses to a survey about Women's History Month (WHM) celebrations. The survey had six questions, and the responses were collected from an unknown number of participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first question (Q1) asked whether the respondent planned to celebrate WHM, and the possible answers were \"Yes\" or \"No.\" - The second question (Q2) was only applicable to those who answered \"Yes\" to Q1 and asked how they planned to celebrate, and the respondents were asked to write their answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The third question (Q3) asked whether the respondent purchased feminist books in honor of WHM, either for themselves or as a gift for someone else. The possible answers were \"Yes\" or \"No.\" The fourth question (Q4) was only applicable to those who answered \"Yes\" to Q3 and asked how many books they typically purchase during March. The possible answers were \"1,\" \"2-Mar,\" \"4 or more.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- The fifth question (Q5) asked what the respondent liked most about Athena's Story. The respondents were asked to write their answers. Athena's Story is likely a store or a website that sells feminist books or products related to WHM celebrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sixth question (Q6) asked what types of books the respondents would like to see more of at Athena's Story. The respondents were asked to write their answers, and the possible answers were \"Feminist fiction,\" \"Feminist zines,\" \"Feminist poetry,\" \"Feminist novels and essays,\" \"Women's history books,\" \"Biographies of inspirational women,\" \"Women's journals,\" and \"Feminist science fiction.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*Limitations*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sample size: The dataset is relatively small, consisting of only 85 responses. This may limit the generalizability of the results to a larger population.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Self-reported data: The data is self-reported, which means that there may be biases or inaccuracies in the responses. For example, respondents may not remember their actual behavior during Women's History Month or may be inclined to over-report positive behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limited survey questions: The survey only consists of six questions, which may not provide a comprehensive view of the respondents' behaviors and attitudes towards Women's History Month.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lack of demographic information: The dataset does not include information about the respondents' age, gender, race, or other demographic characteristics. This information could be helpful in understanding how different groups celebrate or support Women's History Month.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limited context: The dataset does not provide information about the respondents' geographic location, socioeconomic status, or cultural background, which may impact their attitudes and behaviors towards Women's History Month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historical Sales Dataset consist of the sales of four different genres of products (Feminist Fiction, Biographies Children's Literature, and Feminist Zines) per week for a period of 52 weeks. The sales are in USD and are shown for each week.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this dataset to analyze the sales trends of the different products and determine which ones are more popular. We can also use this data to predict future sales and determine whether there are any seasonal trends or patterns. Additionally, we can compare the sales of different genres and determine which ones are growing in popularity or declining. Overall, this dataset can provide valuable insights into the book market and consumer preferences.\n",
    "Customer Survey \n",
    "\n",
    "*Limitations*\n",
    " \n",
    "- Limited information: The dataset only includes sales data for four variables (three product genres and one week variable). Other important information, such as the geographic location, store type, marketing campaigns, and pricing strategies, are not included. Without this information, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions or make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Short time frame: The dataset covers 52 weeks, which may not be sufficient to identify long-term trends or seasonal patterns. It is also possible that the sales patterns in this dataset are unique to this particular year and may not be representative of other years.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lack of context: The dataset does not provide any context or explanation for the sales patterns observed. For example, it is unclear why certain genres had higher or lower sales in specific weeks. Without this context, it is difficult to interpret the data or draw conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Missing data: There are missing data points in the dataset, such as the missing values in the sales of Feminist Zines in Week 46. This missing data may affect the accuracy of any analysis or conclusions drawn from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No indication of sample size or representativeness: There is no information provided about the sample size of the data or how it was collected. It is also not clear if the dataset is representative of a larger population or if it is a sample of specific stores or locations. Without this information, it is difficult to determine the generalizability of the findings\n"
