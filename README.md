# Athena-s-Feminist-Book-store

The goal of this project is to help Athena's Story create a successful campaign in March by using customer survey data to understand their target audience and their preferences for feminist books. We will also use historical sales data to identify the most profitable genres for Athena's Story, including feminist fiction and biographies of inspiring women, as well as newer genres such as children's literature and feminist zines. Based on our analysis, we will provide insights and recommendations to Athena's Story on how to improve their sales and customer engagement.
